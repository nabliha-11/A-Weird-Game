# Gamejam2023

A game which makes no sense.

How to run:
Go to Assets>Scenes>Scene1(Room1)
Play

The game is a mess. It was supposed to go to a room to find keys. But now you have to manually go there.
Yes, it was not supposed to do that.

Then got to Assets>Levels>Level1  for the next scene

Then
Go to Assets>Scenes>Room1
Play
